      <h3>More than just a simple bucket list app</h3>

      <div id="content">
         <!--<img src="img/ripple.jpg" alt="Ripple header image">-->

         <p>Put simply, Ripple is a bucket list app that mainly target users of
         the age group 50 to 80 years old. When our group and I were coming up
         with ideas, we identified a couple main problems that our target group
         often faced. More often than not, they will face boredom,
         loneliness, and lack of interaction with others.</p>

         <img src="img/ripple-team-picture.jpg" alt="Ripple team picture"
         style="width:100%">

         <p>We wanted to create an app that can motivate them to leave their
         comfort zones and participate in activities to spark up their daily
         lives. Because this process begins by taking small steps, one step and
         a time, we saw this as a type of ripple effect. As they participate in
         their first activity, they would begin to meet more people and become
         more inspired to continue carrying an active and social lifestyle.</p>

         <p>Our app has three main features: (1) A user's bucket list, (2) The
         explore and search, (3) Bookmarks. The concept is simple and easy to
         understand. Upon signing up, the user would input basic profile
         information. Then as they explore possible activies through the explore
         page, they will begin to fill their bucket list, and thus begin to
         engage in activities.</p>

         style="width:100%">

         <p>Some of the problems we faced as we were coming up with the idea and
         the prototype was how to make the concept of the app rather focused and
         simple. Because our target group may not be exposed to social media as
         much as most millenials do nowadays, we had to take into consideration
         not to make assumptions that they would also know of and understand 
         certain icons or popular app features. For example, we made sure to
         substitute or complement icons like the star or the bookmark icon with
         labels of the actual word. We also made sure to make a clear navigation
         bar versus swiping to get to certain pages, like in SnapChat. Choice of
         color, font, and layout were also adjusted to help facilitate better
         app usage.</p>

         application, Ripple.</p>
